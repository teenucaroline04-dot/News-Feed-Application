This project is a simple and responsive News Feed website designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main purpose of this website is to display news articles in a clean and organized layout, similar to an online news portal.

The homepage contains a header, content section, and footer. The **header** displays the website title, while the main content area dynamically loads news articles using JavaScript. Each news card includes a title, image, and short description of the news. The images are automatically fetched from Unsplash, giving the site a realistic and professional look.

Users can click the Add Random News button to load a new random news card instantly without refreshing the page. This is achieved through simple JavaScript DOM manipulation and array-based data storage. The website is fully responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes such as mobiles, tablets, and desktops.

The design follows a minimalist and modern approach, using soft shadows, rounded corners, and consistent color themes for a pleasant reading experience. It is lightweight and does not rely on any external libraries or frameworks, which makes it easy to understand and customize.

This project is ideal for beginners learning web development, as it demonstrates how to structure an HTML page, apply CSS styling for layout and responsiveness, and use JavaScript for adding interactive features. It can also be extended to connect with real news APIs to fetch live news updates in the future.
